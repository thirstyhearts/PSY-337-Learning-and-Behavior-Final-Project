        <p>Are you out of breath after going up a single flight of stairs? Maybe you can’t fit in your pants anymore. How about staring at the ceiling until 6:00 AM, hearing your alarm go off in the background. Or everytime you feel stressed are you reaching for the nearest little debbie? (Not a sponsor but it could be, hit me up Debbie) </p>
        <img src="Out Of Breath.jpg" alt="Man Bent Over">
        <p>Trust me, you are not alone in these experiences. Life is becoming more and more sedentary, we have to actively seek out exercising and getting our steps in. This is reflected in America’s obesity rate, nearing almost 50%(National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases 2021). It is hard to adjust your schedule to fit in the exercise or set aside hours evernight to cook healthy meals. However, it is important we put in the work and lower this statistic.Obesity by itself makes it hard to get around and drains your energy but it also increases the risk of many other conditions. Obesity can increase risk of a plethora of health conditions: high blood pressure and high cholesterol which is a risk factor for heart disease, type 2 diabetes, sleep apnea, asthma, gallstones and gallbladder disease.(CDC 2022).
        So what can you do to combat this rising statistic and feel better again? Well, you can use behavior psychology to recondition yourself. </p>
        
        <h2>Sleep</h2>
        <p>I'm going to start this program with sleep because sleep is crucial. Without the energy to make it through the day there is no way you are going to be able to change your habits and routine. There’s this thing called classical conditioning. You may have heard of it in passing, something about a scientist and his weird obsession with dogs and their drool. Well the run down of classical conditioning is pairing a neutral stimulus with a natural response. See more detailed explanation in this article by Saul McLeod from 2024. </p>
        <p>Hold on, let's rewind, what do I mean by neutral stimulus? In simple terms a stimulus can be an object, event, or factor that triggers a response. In simpler simpler terms, a stimulus is something that causes a reaction. A natural response is something that happens naturally without needing a trigger, like a dog drooling. Alright back to how you can snooze quicker. 
        </p>
        <p>So you need to pair something to a behavior. This can be applied to sleep quite easily. Everytime you want to go to bed, grab your phone. On your phone open up meditative music, this can be whale noises, rain falling, oceans crashing against the beach, it doesn’t really matter. Force yourself to do this every night before bed. It is important to keep the same sounds on at first so you can actually associate this with sleep. Technically there’s something called generalization, but this only works after a response has been conditioned. Soon enough, everytime you turn on that sound your body will associate that with sleep and it will be easier to fall asleep. 
        </p>
        <p>This actually works so well it is often used for patients with insomnia. It's just called something a little bit more fancy, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia. And this practice can be seen in many studies that focus on insomnia and the best ways to treat it. One of the first studies to explore this was "A Behavioral Perspective on Insomnia Treatment" written by Arthur J. Spielman, David A. Caruso, and Paul B. Glovinskyin 1987. This study explores many ways to counter insomnia and dared to explore beyond medication and also included behavior based therapy. 
        </p>


        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>I know a big challenge when actually trying to get your life together is finding the motivation to do so. It is easy to say, I’ll start tomorrow or I don’t know where to start. Luckily for us, we are in the age of technology where so much information is available at our fingertips. I also understand this can be overwhelming as well, not knowing where to start in your research. So stop with your overthinking and go watch these youtubers: 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Will Tennyson</li>
            <li>Renaissance Periodization</li>
            <li>Ethan Chewbowski</li>
            <li>Joshua Weissman</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Things to search:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>High Protein Recipes</li>
            <li>Quick and Healthy meals</li>
            <li>Workout Split</li>
            <li>Workout Routine</li>
        </ul>

        <p>So why am I telling you to doom scroll? Because we can apply observational learning to this content. Observational learning is how it sounds, you watch something, you remember it, you replicate it. There technically is a fourth step here called motivation, you have to be motivated to actually learn from the observation. So, having you watch all these rich youtubers try good food, look good, and thrive will either make you feel really guilty or leave you lusting for their life. Either way this can be used to motivate you to replicate what these influencers are doing.  This type of motivation is called extrinsic, which means you are applying a reinforcement or punishment to the activity. In this case the reinforcement comes from the idea of getting praise or wanting the same lifestyle as the youtuber
        </p>
        

        <h2>Stress Eating</h2>
        <p>Speaking of feeling guilty, let's talk about how you can stop stress eating. Stress eating is something I find myself doing constantly and I somehow always fall back into the habit. However, after learning counter conditioning, I realized I was approaching it all wrong. When I used to approach stress eating before, I would just try and will myself to not eat, leaving me still feeling stressed and eventually giving in anyway. At another point I also tried replacing the stress eating with “healthy stress eating”, meaning I was grabbing foods lower in calories or higher in protein. Surprise surprise, this is not a good technique either because I was still overeating. What finally worked for me was having a water bottle nearby. Everytime I start to become overwhelmed I take a sip of water. This simple thing has stopped me from overeating many times. </p>
        <p>This is simple counter conditioning. Counter conditioning is pairing a stimulus with a new neutral/positive response. In this case, the stimulus is stress, the old response was overeating, and the new response is drinking water. This can be done with things other than water. You can replace it with deep breathing, going for a walk, or even reading a book. Really you can cater it to whatever you find healthy for you. You don't just have to take my word for it either, this article by Dr.Jen Kerns layouts our issue as well of being conditioned to food responses. Dr. Kern’s job is to counter conditions with much of the same practices as I laid out above. 
        </p>
        <p>Another way you can reduce stress and overeating is to remove the problem at the source. When grocery shopping, don’t buy the junk food that you typically gravitate towards for those cravings. Instead only buy what is necessary for your meals. Along with this, meal prepping and planning what you are going to eat for the day reduces the amount of time you actually think about food(Haas 2018) This utilizes something called stimulus control. The basic concept of stimulus control is to alter or remove an environment cue that triggers an unwanted behavior or response. In this example, we are removing the cue(food) and by doing this removes the trigger that creates the unwanted response(overeating).
        </p>


        <h2>Exercising</h2>
        <p>Stimulus control can also be used to create a routine or schedule. To start exercising regularly, everyday at the same time, set aside the same amount of time at the same hour and exercise. You don't have to have a set workout or even know what you are doing, you just have to workout everyday at the same hour. At first this is going to be excruciating to do and you will have to fight through not wanting to go exercise. But this will eventually create an environmental cue that says oh, it’s 12:00 PM time to exercise. 
        </p>

        <p>I recognize this can be hard to do so there is also another method to start exercising. Get some type of step tracker and set a goal, 7000 to 10000 is what I typically aim for. Everyday you hit that goal, reward yourself with something you enjoy, like playing games for an extra 15 minutes. A lot of fitness trackers also have a built- in reward system that will help to reinforce the behavior. This type of conditioning is called operant conditioning and this is probably the conditioning you are most familiar with which leads me into the next step…..
        </p>

        <h2>DONT</h2>
        <p>There are obviously healthy and unhealthy ways to approach dieting and exercising. A lot of the time, the go to approach is punishment. If you overeat then you’re not allowed to eat. Or if you don't hit your step goal then that is an extra 15 minutes of exercising. These are both forms of operant conditioning. Operant conditioning is just something you can change by either adding some punishment or reinforcement.. However, your relationship with food and exercise can become unhealthy if you only focus on punishment and not reinforcement. So keep this in mind when you are trying to improve your healthy habits. 
        </p>

        <h2>Feel Less Alone, But In A Smart Way</h2>
        <p>It’s important to remember, many other people struggle with the same issues. If you’re like me then you probably have looked up something like “how to be healthy reddit”. Plenty of posts will come up with good advice and downright terrible. With the information I provided today you should be able to navigate the threads and information online a bit easier. 
        </p>

        <p>Lets take a look at this thread:</p>

        <p>The main steps listed in the thread are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Pick one thing and make it a habit</li>
            <li>Make it stupid easy</li>
            <li>Commit to consistency, not intensity</li>
            <li>Do it everyday</li>
        </ol>

        <p>This is a great example of stimulus control, altering an environmental cue, in this case doing the behavior everyday, and eventually the behavior itself will become integral to that part of day due to the cue. 
        </p>

        <p>All of this is to say, by taking the core principles and concept of behavior psychology you can modify any behavior you would like and now you have the knowledge to do so.
